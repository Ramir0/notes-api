# Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Java 21+](https://adoptium.net/)
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

---

### Running MongoDB with Docker Compose

To start a local MongoDB instance for development and testing, use the provided `docker-compose.yml`:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

This will start MongoDB on port `27017` with a replica set (`rs0`).
You can stop it with
```sh
docker compose down
```

---

### Running the Application

Start the Spring Boot application (ensure MongoDB is running):

```sh
gradle bootRun
```
or
```sh
gradle build
java -jar build/libs/notes-1.0.jar
```

Running Tests
To run all tests:
```sh
gradle test
```
